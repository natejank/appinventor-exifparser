# ExifParse Appinventor Extension
This was an extension primarily created for a midyear project for my AP Computer Science Principles class.  Anyone is 
free to use it, but this wasn't intended for general use, so it might not work as expected.

## How to use:
Because this doesn't use anything other than Android and Java's standard library,
all you need is to build it and add it to your project.
```shell
ant extensions
```
This will put an .aix file in `out`, at which point you can import it into appinventor, and use away!
