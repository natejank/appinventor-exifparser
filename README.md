# ExifParse Appinventor Extension

This was an extension primarily created for personal use in a project in my AP Computer Science Principles class. Anyone is
free to use it if they find it useful.

## How to use

This plugin is designed to be used in conjunction with the ImagePicker or FilePicker blocks. Once you have imported
the extension (using Extension â†’ Import extension in the sidebar), drag the ExifParse component to the screen.
It should display as a non-visible component.

Then, add a code block for ImagePicker.AfterPicking, feeding ImagePicker.Selection and
the EXIF tag you want into ExifParse.getAttribute/setAttribute. For more information
about what the a specific tag means, see the Android Documentation for
[ExifInterface](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/ExifInterface),
or [General EXIF Tag Information](https://exiftool.org/TagNames/EXIF.html).

## Methods

There are only a few procedures that are added with this extension. They have been kept rather simple, so as much of
the code I would use would take place in appinventor instead of the extension. They are as follows:

### getAttribute

- this method takes two arguments
  - a tag name (use the constants provided)
  - a file path (you can get this using something like ImagePicker.Selection)
- It returns the value of the specified tag. If the tag doesn't exist, it returns an empty string.

### setAttributes

- This method takes in two arguments
  - A dictionary of tag names and values (tagname: value)
  - A file path (you can get this from something like ImagePicker.Selection)
- This method will write the new set of attributes to the file provided.

### setAttributesCopy

- This is the same as setAttribute, but it will write to a new file instead.
- This method takes one new argument
  - An output file path, which is where the new metadata will be written to.

### Constants

- All other member attributes are constants. They all represent different EXIF tags, which all need to be set to something
  different. To learn more about a specific tag, look in the [ExifInterface Documentation](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/ExifInterface#constants_1).
  Each constant here should mirror the constants in ExifInterface.

## How to build:

```shell
ant extensions
```

This will put an .aix file in `out`, at which point you can import it into appinventor and use it like any other code block.
